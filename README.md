- 👋 Hi, I’m @mohamdiveten
- 👀 I’m interested in developing applications of value to whoever uses it. Sometimes, I write just for fun and to see magic happen.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about Azure and its services on data... and some other things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .NET based web applications. I love Python and to use it in data analysis as well.
